   npx expo install
   ```
2. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
3. Use Expo Go app on your phone or an emulator to run the app

## Azure Functions (Local Development)

The project includes local Azure Functions in the `/AzureFunctions` directory. These functions are currently running locally and haven't been deployed to Azure.

### Running Azure Functions Locally
1. Navigate to the AzureFunctions directory:
   ```bash
   cd AzureFunctions
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
3. Start the functions locally:
   ```bash
   func start
   ```

### Important Note
- The Azure Functions are currently running locally for development
- They need to be deployed to Azure for production use
- Make sure the functions are running locally when testing the mobile app
- The mobile app is configured to connect to these local functions

## Development Workflow
1. Start the Azure Functions locally
2. Start the Expo app
3. Make changes and test locally
4. When ready for production, deploy the Azure Functions to Azure




# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
